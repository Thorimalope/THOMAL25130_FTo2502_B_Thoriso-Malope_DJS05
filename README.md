# 🎧 React Podcast App

This is a **React-based Podcast App** that displays a list of podcasts and allows users to view detailed information about each one. Podcast data is fetched from a remote API, while genre data is sourced from a local `Data.js` file. The app uses **React Router v6** for routing and navigation between the main list and the podcast detail pages.
